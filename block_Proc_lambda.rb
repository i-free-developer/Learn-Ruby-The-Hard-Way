=begin
A block is just a bit of code between do..end or {}. It's not an object on its own, but it can be passed to methods like .each or .select.
A proc is a saved block we can use over and over.
A lambda is just like a proc, only it cares about the number of arguments it gets and it returns to its calling method rather than returning immediately.
